# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!  
All discussions, proposals, and contributions should happen **only through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests**.  
Please open an issue first before submitting a pull request so we can discuss your idea or change.  

Please also follow our Code of Conduct in all project interactions.

## Pull Request Process

1. Open an issue describing the change you’d like to make before starting a PR.  
2. Make sure your PR is focused — avoid unrelated changes.  
3. Update `README.md` if your change affects usage, features, or configuration.  
4. A maintainer or another contributor should review your PR before it gets merged.
